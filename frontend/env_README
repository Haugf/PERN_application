env.sh is used to allow environment variables to be used at runtime in the React app since React sets process.env values as buildtime.
env.sh will allow use of env variables using the format window.env.ENV_VAR_NAME in your React app.
env.sh creates a env-config.js file populated with by env-variable info which must be run so that the browser has env variables. ex. place <script src="/env-config.js"></script> at top of index.html
env.sh will ONLY use the env variables specified in the .env file. The .env file must have default values, which will be overwritten by the system's/container's environment variables
